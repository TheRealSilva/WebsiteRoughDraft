        <h2>About myself</h2>
        <p> </p>
    </div>
    <img src="IMG_4473.HEIC">
    <p> I am a proudly born and raised guy based in the Portland Metro Area. I grew up my
        entire childhood in the city of Aloha, Oregon. Yes We have rain here for about 9 months and 
        I'm used to this weather lol. I am a very passionate person who grew loving the outdoors and 
        the beauty of nature. I love to hike, swim, and go camping with my friends and family.</p>

        <b>Why I chose Computer Sciecnce:</b> I chose computer science because I have always been fascinated by technology and how it can be used to solve real-world problems. I love the idea of creating software that can make people's lives easier and more efficient. I also enjoy the challenge of problem-solving and the satisfaction that comes from building something from scratch.</p>
    <p> I am currently a student at George Fox University, where I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I am excited to learn more about the field and to gain the skills I need to succeed in my career. I am also looking forward to working on projects that will allow me to apply what I have learned in the classroom to real-world situations.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Future goals:</b>
        My future goals include graduating with a degree in Computer Science, gaining experience through internships and projects, and eventually working as a software engineer. I hope to work on innovative projects that make a positive impact on society and to continue learning and growing in my field. I also aspire to contribute to open-source projects and to mentor others who are interested in pursuing a career in technology.
        If possible, I dream of owning a Web development agency that specializes in creating user-friendly and accessible websites for small businesses and non-profits. I believe that technology should be accessible to everyone, and I want to help bridge the gap between small businesses and the digital world.</p>
